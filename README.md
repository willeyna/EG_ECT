# Embedded Graph Euler Characteristic Transform Computation 

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **Euler Characteristic Transform (ECT)** for 2D embedded graphs utilizing NetworkX. This work was done as undergraduate research. 

The code focuses on computing Euler Characteristic Curves (ECCs) efficiently across multiple directions by identifying *critical angles* and propagating changes between them, rather than recomputing subgraphs from scratch. Both a fast ECT implementation and a naive baseline are included for comparison and experimentation.

The project was built primarily for research and exploration in topological data analysis and graph representations. It includes utilities for generating random embedded graphs, visualizing directional height functions, and converting ECCs into vectorized ECT representations.

This is experimental, research-oriented code rather than a polished library, but it demonstrates the core ideas behind ECT computation on graphs.
